# List of input file commands for NDDEM
### Description
Input files are in plain text.
In the following: 

- double quotes are omitted when obvious
- the syntax `[ xxx | yyy | zzz]` in the following indicates a field that contain eiher `xxx`, `yyy`, or `zzz`.
- words fully capitalise should be replaced by numbers. 
- numbers between braces, eg. `{IDS}`, can have a stepping syntax, similar to matlab, eg. they can be a single number `42`, two numbers separated by column `42:51` (equivalent to `42:1:51`), three numbers separated by columns `42:0.1:51`. The syntax is `beginning:step:end`, the end is inclusive. 

Some command start with an initial keyword, follow by another keyword changing their behaviour.

### Special initial keyword:
- `#`: any line starting with a hash is a comment and is discarded.
- `event TT command`: a line starting with the `event` keyword will be processed only when the time `TT` is elapsed. Basically any other command working by itself can be used as a later time event. 

### Multi-keyword commands
First indentation level keyword must be followed by one of the second level indentation one.

- `set`: set the value of a parameter. Expect a number after the keyword, unless otherwise noted
  - `T`: Total time
  - `dt`: duration of a timestep
  - `tdump`: number of timestep between each dump of result
  - `tinfo`: number of timestep between each line of information in the terminal
  - `rho`: density of the grains
  - `Kn`: normal stiffness
  - `Kt`: tangential stiffness
  - `GammaN`: normal dissipation
  - `GammaT`: tangential dissipation
  - `Mu`: friction coefficient between grains
  - `Mu_wall`: friction coefficient between wall and grains
  - `damping`: global damping coefficient
  - `orientationtracking`: calculate grain orientation or not (expect a true or false value)
  - `skin`: skin size [DEPRECATED, DO NOT USE]
  - `gradientdescent_gamma`: decay rate when used for gradient descent algorithm (only for wall ELLIPSE currently)
  - `gradientdescent_tol`: tolerance for stopping the gradient descent algo. 

- `auto`: perform one of the following operations:
  - `mass`: set the mass of particles from density
  - `rho`: setting the density from the mass of particle #0. 
  - `inertia`: setting the moment of inertia for spheres.
  - `location [square|randomsquare ...]`: set the particle location
    - `square`: square lattice
    - `randomsquare`: square lattice with some randomness in particle location
    - `randomdrop`: random coordinates of the particles in the simulation region
    - `insphere`: randomly place the particles in a sphere, assuming that the wall number d is a sphere. 
    - `roughinclineplane`: stick grain along the plane of normal [1,0,0 ...] to create roughness.
    - `roughinclineplane2`: ????? not quite sure what this does anymore. 
    - `largeroughinclineplane`: Same as `roughinclineplane` but also sets the radius of all frozen particles to the global maximum.
    - `quasicristal`: ????? not quite sure what this does anymore. 
    - `fromfile filename`: set the locations from a textfile. The file should have columns, no delimiters. 1st column is particle id, following columns are the coordinates of location, last column is the particle radius. 
  - `radius [uniform|bidisperse|bidisperse_fuzzy] SMALLRADIUS LARGERADIUS [[RATIO] FUZZYNESS]`: set the particle radius from a distribution. Bidisperse is now defined by volume. For bidisperse, $ratio=V_{large}/(V_{small}+V_{large})$. For `bidisperse_fuzzy`, randomness is added on the small and large radius by the fuzzyness factor (for example, the distribution of small radii will be $SMALLRADIUS*(1+rand(-1,1)*FUZZYNESS)$).
  - `skin`: [DEPRECATED, DO NOT USE] set the skin size. Should be used after the particle radius has been set. 
  
- `rigid N`: handles rigid bodies number N
  - `set NPARTICLES ID1 ID2 ... IDN`: particles belonging to the rigid body. 
  - `gravity [on|off]`: use gravity on the particles of the rigid body or not. 
  - `addforce FX0 FX1 ...`: addforce to the whole rigid body. 
  - `velocity [VX0|nan] [VX1|nan] ... `: set velocity of the rigid body, or not if `nan` is used. 
  
### Singular commands
These command have a single behaviour, described here.

- `directory`: where the data dump are saved. The directory is created if it does not exist. 
- `dimensions D NUMBERPARTICLES`: number of spatial dimensions and particles to use. Need to match the command line arguments.
- `location {IDS} {X0} {X1} ...`: set the location of the indicated particles. 
- `velocity ID X0 X1 ...`: set the velocity of the indicated particles. 
- `omega ID X00 X10 ...`: set the angular velocity of the indicated particles.
- `freeze ID`: set zero acceleration of the indicated particles. 
- `radius ID RAD`: set the particle radius
- `mass ID M`: set the particle mass
- `gravity G0 G1 ... Gd`: set the gravity vector
- `gravityangle INTENSITY ANGLE`: set the gravity angled from first dimension
- `gravityrotate INTENSITY OMEGA DIM1 DIM2`: make the gravity rotate at an angular velocity OMEGA between DIM1 and 2.
- `ContactModel [Hooke|Hertz]`: set contact model.
- `ContactStrategy [naive|cells|octree]`: strategy to find contacts, either naive (NÂ²) or with cells (NlogN maybe?) or with cells+octree (usefull for polydisperse).
- `boundary DIM [PBC|WALL|MOVINGWALL|SPHERE|ROTATINGSPHERE|PBCLE|ELLIPSE] LOCMIN LOCMAX extrainfo`: wall type along dimension DIM (the types are strings, not values). All walls require extra arguments:
  - `MOVINGWALL LOCMIN LOCMAX VELMINX VELMINY`
  - `SPHERE RADIUS X1 ... XD`: sphere of radius RADIUS, center at the X location
  - `HEMISPHERE`
  - `AXIALCYLINDER RADIUS AXIS`: cylinder of the given radius with axis align with the coordinate axis indicated, all other coordinates of the axis vector = 0. 
  - `ROTATINGSPHERE RADIUS X1 ... XD R12 R13 ... R1D R23 ... R_D-1_D`: Rotating sphere of radius RADIUS, center at the X location, rotation matrix given by the R components (upper right corner of the skew-symetric rotation matrix). 
  - `PBCLE LOCMIN LOCMAX VELOCITY`: Lees-Edward boundary condition. Should be in dimension 0. 
  - `ELLIPSE RX RY CX CY`: Ellipse wall (dim 2 only)
  - `allother LOCMIN LOCMAX`
  - Special command: `boundary DIM REMOVE` Delete the boundary in the indicated dimension. Usefull to remove default created boundaries, but use with caution. Note that the boundaries will be renumbered if you do not remove the last one. This sounds ill-advised. 
- `rigid`: TODO (in development) ...
- `mesh [file|translate|rotate|export] ...`
  - `file filename.json`: load a mesh file in json format. See [below](#json-mesh-file-format).
  - `translate X0 X1 ... XN`: translate all the meshes by the given vector
  - `rotate X00 X01 ... X0N X10 ... XNN`: rotate all the meshes by the given rotation vector. Center of rotation is the mesh origin (first point)
  - `erase ID`: erase the mesh with the given ID
  - `export filename.json`: write all the current meshes in a json file
  
- `dumps filename [VTK|NETCDF|XML|XMLbase64|CSV|CSVA|CONTACTFORCES|WALLFORCE] with N [cf. below ...]`: select dump format and output fiels, the last 4 formats are plain text. `N` is how many fields output follow, which will be in the output dumped file. Note that not all fields are available for all formats. Field can include:
  - Particle data field: `[Position|Velocity|Omega|OmegaMag|Orientation|Coordination|Radius|Ids]*`
  - Contact data fields: `[Ids|Fn|Ft|Torque|Branch|Fn_el|Fn_visc|Ft_el|Ft_visc|Ft_fric|Ft_frictype|Ghost_mask|Ghost_direction]*`. NB: if Ghost_mask>0; then the contact crosses a periodic boundary condition. 
  
- `restart [auto|ignore|force] [keepall|evenodd] N filename`: this command performs two operations:
  - Save a restart file every N steps. The command either happen the timestep at the end of the file, after a dash (with `keepall`) or the name `even` or `odd` (with `evenodd`). The latter mode ensure that one restart file is available even if the program is killed while writing the file, which would corrupt the last file, while keeping the disk space low. 
  - If a previous restart file exist:
    - In `auto`, uses the latest available restart file to continue a previously interupted simulation. Any information from the input script or calculation up to that point will be wiped out. 
    - In `force`, uses the provided filename to restart the simulation. Further restart files will be written based on the filename saved in the restart file. 
    - In `ignore`, disregard any existing restart file. 
  - Recommanded defaults would be: `restart auto evenodd ...`



### JSON Mesh file format
Meshes are recorded in a specific file format using json. The file must contain at top level two attributes, `dimension` defining the dimension of the space on which this mesh is to be used (ie. define the number of coordinates of points), and `objects` containing an array of objects. 

Individual objects must contain a `dimensionality` attributes, and a `vertices` attribute which is an array of the locations of the points defining the object. The array of vertices must have size `dimensionality + 1`. The maximum dimensionality of an object is the dimension of the space minus 1, the lowest dimensionality is 0 (single point). 

All objects are [simplexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex), more complex objects can be created by assembling simplexes together. The lower dimensionality edges of a higher dimensionality object are automatically generated (ie. grains will automatically interact with the vertices, edges, and faces of a 3D-tetrahedron in 4D space, with having to define those in the json file).

The jupyter notebook in `scripts/jsonmesh2stl.ipynb` can be used to convert a mesh in `json` format to the more usual `stl` or `vtk` format. For mesh of dimension>3, the mesh are sliced along the 3D space. 

Example of json mesh file:
```json
{
  "dimension": 3,
  "objects": [
    {
      "dimensionality": 2,
      "vertices": [
           [-1 ,-1,  0  ],
           [-1 , 1,  0  ],
           [-0.5, 1, -0.5 ]]
    },{
      "dimensionality": 2,
      "vertices": [
        [   -1, -1,  0   ],
        [ -0.5,  -1, -0.5  ],
        [ -0.5,   1, -0.5  ]]
    }]
}
```
